# 介绍

treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

 It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions[1] or declarations[2] instead of statements
 
  In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are input to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x will produce the same result f(x) each time.

Functional programming typically avoids using mutable state.
Functional programming requires that functions are first-class
